Projects that are worth checking out

For every line of code there are comments explaining its purpose and its functionality.

    - E-class Demo:
        Project is from Object Oriented Programming course, 3rd semester, and is 100% on C++.

        We were requested to construct a demo simulation of the e-class platform of our school.
        This project was supposed to highlight the use of overloading functions in C++ and better understanting the concept of inheritenc and friendship.

        Both project 1 and 2 have Readme files that summarize their contents, both in greek and in english.

        Project 2 folder contains the main part of this course's project.
    
    - AI:
        This folder containts all the projects of the Artificial Intelligence course, 5th semester.

        The projects are the exact same as the Berkeley Pacman Projects (1, 2 and 3) and also have theoritical exercises based on the search algorithms that 
        we are implementing each time. The pdfs containing my answers to the theoritical exercises are only in greek :/
        
        On the Pacman projects, i've achieved a perfect score on the autograder test for every exercise :)

    - Matlab search methods:
        This project is from the lab exercises from the Numerical Analysis course, 5th semester.

        Î¤he purpose of the work was to implement some iterative root search methods that we learned in the theoretical part of the course 
        in matlab programming code. We also had to analyze the results of the functions we made and comment on them based on the theory we have learned in the subject. The results of the code as well as my comments on them are in the word document, however the comments are only available in greek ://



    - lite_htmling:
        I've included some lite html work that i've done for school since it was some fun and intresting hw.
