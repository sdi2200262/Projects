Projects that are worth checking out

For every line of code there are comments explaining its purpose and its functionality.

    - E-class Demo:
        Project is from Object Oriented Programming course, 4th semester, and is 100% on C++.

        We were requested to construct a demo simulation of the e-class platform of our school.
        This project was supposed to highlight the use of overloading functions in C++ and better understanting the concept of inheritenc and friendship.

        Both project 1 and 2 have Readme files that summarize their contents, both in greek and in english.

        Project 2 folder contains the main part of this course's project.
    
    -AI:
        This folder containts all the projects of the Artificial Intelligence course, 5th semester.

        The projects are the exact same as the Berkeley Pacman Projects (1, 2 and 3) and also have theoritical exercises based on the search algorithms that 
        we are implementing each time. The pdfs containing my answers to the theoritical exercises are only in greek :/
        
        On the Pacman projects, i've achieved a perfect score on the autograder test for every exercise.
